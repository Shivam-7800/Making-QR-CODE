# QR CODE 

you can generate QR codes using the qrcode library in Python along with OpenCV to display the generated QR code. 
First, you'll need to install the qrcode library if you haven't already:

# BEFORE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU CHECK THIS QR CODE IS WORKING OR NOT IN YOUR SYSTEM.

NOW THERE IS STEP WISE STEP HOW QR CODE YOU CAN GENRATE YOURSELF ! 


# Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

$ Importing Libraries:
# import qrcode:
Imports the qrcode library, which is used to generate QR codes.
# Defining Data:
data = "https://www.example.com": Defines the data that you want to encode in the QR code. In this example, it's a URL, but it could be any text or data.
# Generating QR Code:
qr = qrcode.QRCode(...): Creates a QRCode object from the qrcode library. This object represents the QR code that will be generated.
# qr.add_data(data):
Adds the data to the QR code object.
# qr.make(fit=True):
Generates the QR code based on the data added to the QR code object. The fit=True argument tells the library to automatically adjust the size of the QR code based on the amount of data.
# Creating Image:
qr_img = qr.make_image(...): Creates an image representation of the QR code using the make_image method of the QR code object. You can specify the fill color (fill_color) and background color (back_color) of the QR code. In this case, the QR code will have black squares on a white background.
# Saving Image:
qr_img.save("example_qr_code.png"): Saves the generated QR code image to a file named "example_qr_code.png". You can specify any filename you want.
# Displaying Image:
qr_img.show(): Displays the QR code image using the default image viewer associated with your system. This line is optional and depends on your system configuration. 

If you're running this code in an environment without a graphical interface, like a server or a script running in the background, you may not be able to display the image directly.
That's the breakdown of each part of the code. It essentially creates a QR code from the provided data, saves it as an image file, and optionally displays it.
